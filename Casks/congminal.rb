  caveats <<~EOS
    This app is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized. On first launch, allow it
    in System Settings > Privacy & Security if macOS blocks it.
    SSH/SFTP uses the system OpenSSH client; SFTP needs OpenSSH 8.7+ with askpass.
    The authentication helper remains inside the app bundle.
